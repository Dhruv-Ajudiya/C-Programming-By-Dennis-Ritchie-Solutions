This repository contains solutions to the exercises from The C Programming Language, written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. This book is widely considered the definitive guide to learning C, and the exercises at the end of each chapter are invaluable for building a deep understanding of the language. Whether you're a beginner to C or looking to refine your skills, this repo offers a collection of well-commented solutions to help you master the core concepts of C programming.

In this repository, you’ll find solutions to all the exercises across the chapters, organized in a way that makes it easy to follow. Each solution is accompanied by clear explanations to help you understand not just the “how” but also the “why” behind the code. This approach is designed to foster both practical and theoretical knowledge of C.

Feel free to fork this repo, use it for personal learning, or contribute if you have improvements or suggestions. This project is meant to be a helpful resource for anyone learning or teaching C programming. If you encounter any issues or have questions about the solutions, don’t hesitate to open an issue or create a pull request.

Happy coding and good luck with your C journey!🚀
